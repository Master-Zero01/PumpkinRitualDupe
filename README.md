**PumpkinRitualDupe** adds a custom Halloween ritual mechanic where players can perform a mystical ceremony using pumpkins and lightning to *duplicate* an item they hold — if the pumpkins approve.  

It’s lightweight, configurable, and designed to bring that eerie Halloween atmosphere to your world without relying on datapacks or external dependencies.

## 🧩 How It Works

Players build a **3×3 ritual circle** on the ground, with a *center block* and *8 surrounding blocks*.  
Then, they hold any item in their main hand and **right-click the center block**.

If the ritual is built correctly and the pumpkins approve (based on chance), lightning will strike and the held item will duplicate!
